The endpoints and the example json are in the github readme.

I didn't have time to do all the validations I would have liked to add. Nor to make the tests 100%.

To use the api, you have to execute the command "node server.js".

Thank you for your understanding.

I used node.js because it is the language with which I have more experience to make APIs.
